# PokiiMap by KiiDev
Po**kii**Map is basically PokeVision on Android, an app to help you san for pokemons in a map, because it's really important to catch'em all!

###[WARNING] If you try to catch the pokemon and they all fleed, that means you teleport too much and is temporarily blocked from catching anything. Close the game and wait 15 mins before trying it again!
####Do NOT use the same account on your phone at the same time, it will look like you are at 2 locations at the same time which is an obvious signal of cheating

- Download and install the APK
- Press the buttons to play

# Development
Quick story, my wife had been obsessively playing PokemonGO since its release. I wrote this app mainly to help her play it. It's working pretty well so I decided to polish it a bit and contribute it back to the community. Download it if you like the game and hopefully it helps you. If you are a developer, fork it and join me build some awesome things before they start cracking down private API uses. 

To start, import it into android studio. Then get a google map API key from google, add it to google_maps_api.xml. Build and have fun! (Messy codes warning)
